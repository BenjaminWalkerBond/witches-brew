# witches-brew
A create react application that displays JSON data from a custom cocktail api.


NOTE: Work in progress. This project is a refactorization of the software engineering project during my undergraduate career. The previous application have many visual inconsistencies which ruin the user experience. This is a modernization of the application using React and Tailwind.css.
